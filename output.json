    "authors": "Ali Muzaffar, Hani Ragab Hassen, Hind Zantout, Michael A Lones",
    "abstract": "  The growing popularity of Android requires malware detection systems that can\nkeep up with the pace of new software being released. According to a recent\nstudy, a new piece of malware appears online every 12 seconds. To address this,\nwe treat Android malware detection as a streaming data problem and explore the\nuse of active online learning as a means of mitigating the problem of labelling\napplications in a timely and cost-effective manner. Our resulting framework\nachieves accuracies of up to 96\\%, requires as little of 24\\% of the training\ndata to be labelled, and compensates for concept drift that occurs between the\nrelease and labelling of an application. We also consider the broader\npracticalities of online learning within Android malware detection, and\nsystematically explore the trade-offs between using different static, dynamic\nand hybrid feature sets to classify malware.\n",

    "title": "A Tournament of Transformation Models: B-Spline-based vs. Mesh-based\n  Multi-Objective Deformable Image Registration",
    "authors": "Georgios Andreadis, Joas I. Mulder, Anton Bouter, Peter A. N. Bosman, Tanja Alderliesten",
    "abstract": "  The transformation model is an essential component of any deformable image\nregistration approach. It provides a representation of physical deformations\nbetween images, thereby defining the range and realism of registrations that\ncan be found. Two types of transformation models have emerged as popular\nchoices: B-spline models and mesh models. Although both models have been\ninvestigated in detail, a direct comparison has not yet been made, since the\nmodels are optimized using very different optimization methods in practice.\nB-spline models are predominantly optimized using gradient-descent methods,\nwhile mesh models are typically optimized using finite-element method solvers\nor evolutionary algorithms. Multi-objective optimization methods, which aim to\nfind a diverse set of high-quality trade-off registrations, are increasingly\nacknowledged to be important in deformable image registration. Since these\nmethods search for a diverse set of registrations, they can provide a more\ncomplete picture of the capabilities of different transformation models, making\nthem suitable for a comparison of models. In this work, we conduct the first\ndirect comparison between B-spline and mesh transformation models, by\noptimizing both models with the same state-of-the-art multi-objective\noptimization method, the Multi-Objective Real-Valued Gene-pool Optimal Mixing\nEvolutionary Algorithm (MO-RV-GOMEA). The combination with B-spline\ntransformation models, moreover, is novel. We experimentally compare both\nmodels on two different registration problems that are both based on pelvic CT\nscans of cervical cancer patients, featuring large deformations. Our results,\non three cervical cancer patients, indicate that the choice of transformation\nmodel can have a profound impact on the diversity and quality of achieved\nregistration outcomes.\n",
