    "abstract": "  Parallel text-to-speech models have been widely applied for real-time speech\nsynthesis, and they offer more controllability and a much faster synthesis\nprocess compared with conventional auto-regressive models. Although parallel\nmodels have benefits in many aspects, they become naturally unfit for\nincremental synthesis due to their fully parallel architecture such as\ntransformer. In this work, we propose Incremental FastPitch, a novel FastPitch\nvariant capable of incrementally producing high-quality Mel chunks by improving\nthe architecture with chunk-based FFT blocks, training with receptive-field\nconstrained chunk attention masks, and inference with fixed size past model\nstates. Experimental results show that our proposal can produce speech quality\ncomparable to the parallel FastPitch, with a significant lower latency that\nallows even lower response time for real-time speech applications.\n",
