    "abstract": "  The vanilla Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) uses a low-pass filter to\nextract low-frequency signals from graph topology, which may lead to the\nover-smoothing problem when GCN goes deep. To this end, various methods have\nbeen proposed to create an adaptive filter by incorporating an extra filter\n(e.g., a high-pass filter) extracted from the graph topology. However, these\nmethods heavily rely on topological information and ignore the node attribute\nspace, which severely sacrifices the expressive power of the deep GCNs,\nespecially when dealing with disassortative graphs. In this paper, we propose a\ncross-space adaptive filter, called CSF, to produce the adaptive-frequency\ninformation extracted from both the topology and attribute spaces.\nSpecifically, we first derive a tailored attribute-based high-pass filter that\ncan be interpreted theoretically as a minimizer for semi-supervised kernel\nridge regression. Then, we cast the topology-based low-pass filter as a\nMercer's kernel within the context of GCNs. This serves as a foundation for\ncombining it with the attribute-based filter to capture the adaptive-frequency\ninformation. Finally, we derive the cross-space filter via an effective\nmultiple-kernel learning strategy, which unifies the attribute-based high-pass\nfilter and the topology-based low-pass filter. This helps to address the\nover-smoothing problem while maintaining effectiveness. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that CSF not only successfully alleviates the over-smoothing\nproblem but also promotes the effectiveness of the node classification task.\n",

    "authors": "Chengbo Zheng, Kangyu Yuan, Bingcan Guo, Reza Hadi Mogavi, Zhenhui Peng, Shuai Ma, Xiaojuan Ma",
    "abstract": "  The increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by students in learning\npresents new challenges for assessing their learning outcomes in project-based\nlearning (PBL). This paper introduces a co-design study to explore the\npotential of students' AI usage data as a novel material for PBL assessment. We\nconducted workshops with 18 college students, encouraging them to speculate an\nalternative world where they could freely employ AI in PBL while needing to\nreport this process to assess their skills and contributions. Our workshops\nyielded various scenarios of students' use of AI in PBL and ways of analyzing\nthese uses grounded by students' vision of education goal transformation. We\nalso found students with different attitudes toward AI exhibited distinct\npreferences in how to analyze and understand the use of AI. Based on these\nfindings, we discuss future research opportunities on student-AI interactions\nand understanding AI-enhanced learning.\n",
